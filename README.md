# netVax

Simulation study to identify indirect protection of vaccination with a transmissible vaccine.
## code/twostage
- analysis: each script is used to create all tables
- figs: scripts used to create Figure 2
- prelim: scripts used to create preliminary data (transmission rate that corresponds to the input R0 for each type of network structure)
- sim: scripts used to create simulation bank for analysis
- testing: various scripts used for testing

## code_output
- prelim: preliminary data necessary for simulations (transmission rate that corresponds to the input R0 for each type of network structure)
- twostage/rData: all output files by scripts in code/twostage/analysis
- twostage/sims: all simulations output by scripts in code/twostage/sim

These programs are a work in progress, as we work to improve usability, error-catching, and speed of analysis. If you find errors, please contact Justin Sheen at jsheen (at) princeton (dot) edu.
