# netVax

Simulation study to identify indirect protection of vaccination with a transmissible vaccine.
## code/twostage
### analysis/revision:
- Scripts used for analysis of simulation data. These file obtains the required sample sizes using the simulation bank generated by the files in code/twostage/sim. Each file is named as (Poisson contact structure or "" for overdispersed contact structure)_antici_(Estimand of interest).R.
### figs: 
- These are scripts used to create Figure 2.
### prelim: 
- scripts used to create preliminary data, i.e., transmission rate that corresponds to the input R0 for each type of network structure. getPrelim_SEIR_Pois.py obtains these parameters when the contact structure is Poisson distributed while getPrelim_SEIR.py obtains these parameters when the contact structure is overdispersed (k=1).
### sim: 
- Scripts used to create simulation bank for analysis. sim_twostage_SEIR_antici_revision.py creates simulations for overdispersed contact structures where trials are anticipatory, sim_twostage_SEIR_Pois_antici_revision.py creates simulations for Poisson contact structures where trials are anticipatory, and sim_twostage_SEIR_Pois_revision.py creates simulations for Poisson contact structures where trials are reactionary.
- Users can specify the following epidemiological parameters for the set of simulations they wish to create: number of animals per cluster, R0 of the wildtype pathogen, R0 of the vaccine, vaccine efficacy, percentage initially vaccinated, whether the vaccine is traditional or transmissible, and the number of simulations users wish to create.
### testing: 
- Miscellaneous scripts used for testing. These include code to look at the variation in infection burden across simulations and plotting the degree distribution of networks.

## code_output
### prelim: 
- Preliminary data necessary for simulations, i.e., transmission rate that corresponds to the input R0 for each type of network structure. See above section "code/twostage/prelim" for more details.
### twostage/rData: 
- All output files by scripts in code/twostage/analysis. See above section "code/twostage/analysis/revision" for more details.
### twostage/sims: 
- All simulations output by scripts in "code/twostage/sim"

These programs are a work in progress, as we work to improve usability, error-catching, and speed of analysis. If you find errors, please contact Justin Sheen at jsheen (at) princeton (dot) edu.
